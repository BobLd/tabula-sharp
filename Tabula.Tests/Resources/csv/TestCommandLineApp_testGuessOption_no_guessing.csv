E-PRTR pollutants and their thresholds
""
A facility has to report data under E-PRTR if it fulfils the following criteria:
• the facility falls under at least one of the 65 E-PRTR economic activities. The
activities are also reported using a statistical classification of economic activities
(NACE rev 2)
• the facility has a capacity exceeding at least one of the E-PRTR capacity
thresholds
• the facility releases pollutants or transfers waste off-site which exceed specific
thresholds set out in Article 5 of the E-PRTR Regulation. These thresholds for
"releases of pollutants are specified for each media - air, water and land - in Annex"
II of the E-PRTR Regulation.
